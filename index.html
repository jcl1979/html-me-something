        <header><h1><em><b>Old Print Methods <u>Rock!</b></u></em></h1>
            <p>This page explores <em>Lithography</em>, the first &quot;modern&quot; printing method<br>
                 along with an older <em>Intaglio</em> printing technique. Not dicussed here, but <br>
                 interesting none the less, is an ancient print method, <em>Relief</em> printing,<br>
                 See <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woodblock_printing_in_Japan">Japanese woodblock printing</a> for an example of relief prints.</p>

                <h1><u>Lithography</u></h1>

                <p>Lithography was invented in 1796 by German author and actor Alois Senefelder,<br>
                 and originally used an image drawn on smooth limestone with oil, fat, or wax and<br>
                then tranferred to paper. It was a relatively inexpensive process that allowed for<br>
                &quot;mass production&quot; of artwork, literature, and cartography. A process so<br>
                effective that a similar method is used to fabricate electric circuits today! </p>
                <h1><u>Chromolithography</u></h1>

                <p>Chromolithography includes all types of lithography that are printed in color and<br>
                 became the most successful method of color printing by the 19th century. Until the <br>
                introduction of chromolithographs, black and white prints were hand painted with watercolor.<br>
                Although chromos could be mass-produced, it took about three months to draw colors onto <br>
                the stones and another five months to print a thousand copies.</p>
                <h1><u>Mezzotints</u></h1>
                <img src=http://images.worthpoint.com/files/freeman/full/769/496769_view_01.jpg />
                <h5>George Caleb Bingham <em>Stump Speaking</em> New York 1858</h5>
                <p>Mezzotint is a printmaking process of the intaglio family. It was the first tonal<br>
                 method to be used, enabling half-tones to be produced without using line or dot-based<br>
                 techniques like hatching, cross-hatching or stipple. Mezzotint achieves tonality by<br>
                 roughening the plate with thousands of little dots made by a metal tool with small teeth,<br>
                 called a "rocker." In printing, the tiny pits in the plate hold the ink when the face<br>
                 of the plate is wiped clean. A high level of quality and richness in the print can be achieved.</p>

                <p>One of the most practical applications of lithography/chromolithography was the <br>
                production of relatively inexpensive and accurate maps for the masses. They could<br>
                literally open up the world in a way that until then, was only available to the wealthy<br>
                and the military. </p>
